hex
===

This is a scratchpad project for figuring out how to represent and work with 
a hexagonal map (as in a game map).  Long-term, I'm interested in making 
working online versions of [these old single-player wargames] [wargames] 
in the browser or whatnot.  For now I'm just interested in figuring out a 
workable way to represent [the hex map itself][map].  In my initial research 
I've mostly been looking at some useful pages from [Amit Patel][amit] at 
Stanford.
